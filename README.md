we are using http://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate for handling migrations. in app's container migrations are being run every time it starts running.

### Clean Architecture :
Layers ( from the most abstract to the most concrete ) :
- domain : abstract data structures
- uc : "use cases", the pure business logic
- implem : implementations of the interfaces used in the business logic (uc layer)
- infra : setup/configuration of the implementation
